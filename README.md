# Space Intern
Hello my name is… Intern! Space Intern is an interactive story RPG where you play an intern on NASA’s first mission to Mars. Your crew faces a variety of challenges and dangers, and as the Intern, it’s your job to make sure everything and everyone returns home safely. If you succeed you can add this to your resume, but fail and you'll be stuck floating in space. Play through a fun story, solve puzzles, and learn about the real science of long-term space exploration. Don't forget to check your email for warnings, tasks from other crew members, and messages from family. Space Intern runs on any modern browser that supports WebGL and was built in Unity for Astronauts ages 10-14.

## Main Objectives
The Space Intern aims to introduce and explore the aforementioned challenges astronauts will face when traveling by simulating a roundtrip mission to Mars. To help the mission succeed the player "Intern" will be tasked to accomplish a list of everyday activities delegated by mission control and their fellow crewmates. The game incorporates tasks such as discussing topics on sleep patterns, dealing with hyper and microgravity, cosmic radiation, physical exercise, and meal planning, to mention a few.

## Benefits

- Provides interactive user experiences through the decision-making process that affects the quality and direction of your player's space mission (eg. completing assigned tasks for minigames)

*As Filipino-Americans we have also included our culture of “salo-salo”, which translates to “eating together” as vital to crew mental health and camaraderie. We want to emphasize to young children the importance of eating together and how preparing meals is a language of love and will be important as we venture into space.*
